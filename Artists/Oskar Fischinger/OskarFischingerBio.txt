The visuals of An Optical Poem grew out of a short sequence at the end of Fischinger's earlier, independently-produced Composition in Blue (1935), in which a group of circles rise from the background and, in depth, head toward the viewer. Such effects would form the basis for the entirety of the new film. Fischinger built elaborate scaffolding in his studio from which he could suspend various geometric cutouts from extra-fine fishing line. According to Moritz, he also used "...lights hung from various vantage points to create strong shadows that would emphasize depth. The geometric figures in the film circles, triangles, and rectangles were cut from paper and painted in specific hues, then attached to a fish line that could be tied to one of the overhead cross beams. With a painted background behind, each of the paper figures would be moved a millimeter before another film-frame could be shot, then moved a millimeter, etc."
